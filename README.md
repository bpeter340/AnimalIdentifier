###### This repository is the product of Indiana Tech's Object Orientation course. 

**The purpose of this course was to become familar with the fundamental logic of object orientation. Therefore, we covered and implemented the following topics:** 

- Inheritance
- Abstraction
- Polymorphism
- Software Reuse

To test our implementation skills, all of our assignments built upon each other. Initially we were given a program that read an image file and decided what was in that image using a machine learning api. *Our objective, as students, was to add functionality to that program through object orientation.*
